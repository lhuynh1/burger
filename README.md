# burger

eat-da-burger is a resturant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat. 

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
